Short Answer

1. What is a real-life scenario that uses linear search?
  Looking for an empty study cube at the library. You go down the line looking in each cube to see if someone is there until you find an empty one.

2. What is a real-life scenario that uses binary search?
  Finding a book in the library, if they are in alphabetical order. You would find a middle shelf/stack and determine if your book would be to the right or left of it, eliminating shelves and then books as you go until you find your book.

3. Given the alphabetically sorted collection in this checkpoint, how many iterations would it take to find the value G using linear search?
  7 iterations

4. Given the alphabetically sorted collection in this checkpoint, how many iterations would it take to find the value G using binary search?
  3 iterations

5. Given an unsorted collection of a million items, which algorithm would you choose between linear search and binary search? Explain your reasoning.
  I would use a linear search since binary searches only work on sorted data collections.

6. Given a sorted collection of a million items, which algorithm would you choose between linear search and binary search? Explain your reasoning.
  Binary search, it would be much faster to eliminate data points that are irrelevant to your search since the data is sorted.

Programming Assignment:

1. You and a friend have set a wager to see who can find the word "Albatross" in the dictionary the fastest. Write a program to allow you to win the bet.

const dictionary = ['albarello', 'albarium', 'albata', 'albategnius', 'albatross','albay', 'albedo', 'albedometer', 'albee', 'albeit', 'albemarle', 'albeniz', 'albergo']

function findWord(dictionary, word) {
   let lowIndex = 0;
   let highIndex = dictionary.length - 1;

   while(lowIndex <= highIndex) {
      let midIndex = Math.floor((lowIndex + highIndex) / 2);
      if(dictionary[midIndex] > word) {
         highIndex = midIndex - 1;
      }
      else if(dictionary[midIndex] < word) {
         lowIndex = midIndex + 1;
      }
      else {
         return dictionary[midIndex];
      }
   }

   return "Not Found";
};

findWord(dictionary, "Albatross")

2. You work at a pet store, and a child has asked you to net the only white-spotted goldfish from the fish tank. Write a program that will help you net the right fish.

const fishTank = [ { name: "goldfish", hasWhiteSpots: false }, { name: "goldfish", hasWhiteSpots: false } , { name: "goldfish", hasWhiteSpots: false } , { name: "goldfish", hasWhiteSpots: false } , { name: "goldfish", hasWhiteSpots: false } , { name: "goldfish", hasWhiteSpots: true }, { name: "goldfish", hasWhiteSpots: false } ]

function findFish(fishCollection) {
   for(let i = 0; i < fishCollection.length; i++) {
      if(fishCollection[i].hasWhiteSpots) {
         return "Caught the fish!";
      }
   }
   return "Sorry, no more white-spotted fish";
}

findFish(fishTank)
