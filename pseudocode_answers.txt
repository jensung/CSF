Short answers:

1. Why do programmers use pseudocode?
Pseudocode is used to help develop algorithms or rough draft/outline code. It is a way for programmers to express or plan what the code is going to do without a particular language. 
2. If you run pseudocode on your computer what would happen?
The pseudocode would not do anything. Perhaps an error message would appear but no real coding was done therefore no app or webpage would be created.

Programming Assignment.

1. Create a function that takes two numbers and prints out the greater number.

INPUT first number
INPUT second number
IF the first number is greater than the second number THEN
  PRINT the first number
ELSE 
  PRINT the second number
END IF

2. Create a function that prints out the number from 1 to 100.

INIT number = 1
FOR number is less than or equal to 100
  PRINT number
  ADD 1 to number
END FOR

3. Create a function that searches for a specific entry in a phonebook

PROMPT for userInput of fullName to search.
 FOR each entry in the phonebook
    IF fullName === full name of the phonebook entry
    PRINT phonebook entry data
    END IF
 END FOR

4. Using the pseudocode you wrote for the previous question, implement it in any computer language of your choice.

var userInput = prompt();
for (i=0; i <= phoneBook.length; i++) {
    if (userInput === phonebook.fullName) {
      return phonebook.fullName + " - " + phonebook.phoneNumber
     }
}
